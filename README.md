Jack Wember mainly focused on building the main calculator screen, setting up the ConstraintLayout for
the top section and creating the button grid below. They coded all the math operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, plus the square root and backspace features.
They also made sure the clear button shows a confirmation dialog and handled the lifecycle
stuff so the display resets when you leave the app. Johnny Zheng worked on the settings page,
building the theme switcher for dark and light modes and adding spinners for font sizes and
color choices. They got SharedPreferences working to save everything and made sure the
manifest was configured properly so the app doesn't crash when you rotate your phone.
